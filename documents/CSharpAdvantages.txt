What has your experience been like as a Java programmer switching to C#?
I use them both for different projects.

I learned Java before C#. These are my observations:

C# is a breath of fresh air. It has a lot of features that I wish java had. Features such as events, LINQ, value types, reified generics, await/async. Those things are absolutely wonderful

It also has nicer syntax sugar: auto-properties, partial classes, type inference, operator overloading, and pattern matching.

That said, java has a much better ecosystem and libraries. Spring has no equivalent in C#, doing AOP in C# is much harder. There are free drivers for everything, all backend systems integrate well with java, there are better logging frameworks, testing frameworks, build systems, static analysis tools, debuggers, profilers, etcâ€¦

In summary, C# is a much better language, while java has a much better community.
